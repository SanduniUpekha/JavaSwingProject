This project is a Java Swing application that I developed during the "Programming in Java" module at W3 Campus and UCSC. The Bookshop Management System allows efficient management of bookshop inventory with GUI programming and Swing features.

## Features

- Add Book Details: Easily add book information like title, author, edition, and price to the system's database.

- Update Book Details: Make necessary updates to existing book information for accurate records.

- Delete Book Details: Remove books from the inventory to maintain an organized database.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Primary programming language for the application's functionality and logic.

- SQL: For efficient data handling and retrieval.

- Eclipse IDE: Development environment for coding.

- MySQL Server: Storing the bookshop data.

- MySQL Workbench: Database design, querying, and management.

- MySQL JDBC Connector: Connecting Java application with the MySQL database.
